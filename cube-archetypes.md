# Cube Archetypes

[My cube](http://www.cubetutor.com/viewcube/4642). Pretty standard.

## White
White has strong aggro support (lots of cheap creatures), specifically, 
token generation and mass pump. It also has powerful removal options, sweepers,
and so it supports control as well.

Mono-white comes together often and is an aggressive deck with cheap creatures,
pump, and a bit of removal to clear the way. Armageddon / Ravages of War are
nice 'finishers' here.

### Blue/White
Two options here: a hard control deck with counters, sweepers, and planeswalkers
or good creatures as finishers. Second option is a tempo deck (aggro-control,
Delver, Faeries, etc). Here we'd want creatures like Man-o-War or Wake Thrasher,
that either hit hard or have disruptive abilities, or Brimaz, that snowball
out of control; then removal like Swords to Plowshares or counters like
Counterspell and Mana Leak to keep the opponent off the board while you win.
Unlike the control version, the tempo deck won't actively want planeswalkers
or sweepers, or expensive finishers.

### Black/White
I think this is strongest as an aggressive tokens build. Payoff cards include
mass pump in both black and white, and sacrifice abilities in black (Braids).
Black and white have great removal combined, so your game plan is probably
similar to Blue/White Tempo; you lose counterspells, but get better removal and
also hand disruption like Thoughtseize. I tend to like having the counterspells,
but the BW build has the ability to snowball (Drana, Braids) in a way that UW
doesn't.

BW can also be a control build, though I tend to be scared of non-blue control
decks. I haven't actively tried to draft BW control, though I've ended up in it
when my draft didn't come together.

### Red/White
RW plays similarly to BW aggressive, often tokens-based. You get red burn! When
drafting burn spells, prioritize the ones that hit both players and creatures
(most cube spells do this, but not Mizzium Mortars). Purphoros is quite good
in most RW decks.

### Green/White
I don't love GW in cube. I may need to give it a try (or maybe give it more
support in my cube). So far I've only ended up in GW midrange when the draft
didn't go well.

## Blue

Mono blue will almost never come together as the blue cube cards are good and
if blue seems that open, multiple players will jump in.

Similarly, if you are drafting UX, I think it's correct to take the blue card
when choosing between a U and X card of equal power level. If it's true that
more players will end up in blue, the other card is more likely to wheel to you.

I could be wrong about the above, depending on the table. If blue is going to be
overdrafted you shouldn't get into it. Of course this is true of all formats and
all colors, but blue in cube is a strong enough special case that it is worth
calling out.

### Blue/Black
Almost always control, often reanimator. When drafting reanimator make sure to
pick up all the pieces - entomb / discard effects, reanimation effects, and
fatties. Fatties are the least important except possibly Griselbrand. Note that
you can include cards you are unable to hardcast - there's not much practical
difference between 4BBBB and 5GGG, in that even the 4BBBB card will likely get
cast first via reanimation, not mana. If you're all-in reanimator, try to get
some protection for your combo. Force of will, Daze, Force Spike are good, or
Thoughtseize effects.

For UB control decks in general (which may still include some reanimation - 
Animate Dead should probably go in any black deck), prioritize counterspells
and broken blue cards (Treachery, JTMS, etc). Black will often be easy to pick
up later, and the black wrath / sacrifice / removal spells are more
interchangeable.

### Blue/Red
Generally some form of a counter/burn, control, or tempo deck. A full prowess
deck is probably not supported (TODO?). Twin combo is supported. Opposition is possible in UR (probably it's possible in any UX).

### Blue/Green
Often ramp with some counter backup. I personally prioritize the ramp spells
and blue cards (generally counterspells and broken blue cards). Edric is a UG
card but honestly I'm not sure it fits into the dominant archetype.

Edric does fit into UG Opposition, which is a great deck if you get the
namesake card.

## Black

### Black/Red

### Black/Green

## Red

Mono red is great in cube, if it's open. You need all your picks since you will
see packs that don't have a red card, so you need to decide to do this p1p1.
Prioritize 1 and 2 drop creatures, and burn. Plan for 24-25 nonland cards. There
will be a ton of replaceable 3+ drops, and they are all about the same with the
exception of Sulfuric Vortex which should be picked over anything. So strongly
suggest taking burn and cheaper creatures first. I feel you will pick up enough
3+ drops by accident.

### Red/Green
Can make this ramp in which case it will be mostly green, with some Titan or
Chandras, and red burn to disrupt opposing creatures. Kiki will be good here.
It's probably possible to splash a second color.

Other option is RG beatdown e.g. Kird Ape. Plays similarly to Mono Red but with
worse mana and beefier creatures. I haven't seen this work yet.

## Green

Green's aggressive cards seem to not get drafted, ever. If I'm unwilling to
take them myself I should take them out.
