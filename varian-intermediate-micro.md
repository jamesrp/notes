# Hal Varian - Intermediate Microeconomics
search for e.g. "varian intermediate microeconomics filetype:pdf" on google.

there is a workbook: "varian bergstrom workouts filetype:pdf"

## ch1 - the market
* supply and demand curves, derivation from reservation prices;
* price maximization via profit(q) := price * q(price)
* pareto efficiency

## ch2 - budget constraint
* budget set {x: cx <= m}. assuming prices are positive, this is a simplex.
* describing change of budget set under changes in m or in c.
* government interventions: tax, subsidy, etc just change the apparent price of goods. rationing imposes another linear constraint on budget set.

## ch3 - preferences
* preferences and indifference curves
* marginal rate of substitution is slope of indifference curve: MRS = -d_x1/d_x2
* useful to use dollars as one of the goods [but how does this look in n dimensions? a tangent plane giving all i-j exchange rates?]

## ch4 - utility
* derive utility from preferences
* ordinal utility, essentially just labeling the nested indifference curves with arbitrary increasing numbers. preserved under [order-preserving transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function)
* cardinal utility would be an ordinal utility that also supported e.g. addition, multiplication. but it doesn't have any justification.
* Cobb-Douglas utility function: product of x_i ^ c_i (can assume c_i sum to 1). Alternatively, sum of c_i log(x_i).
* marginal utility := dU/dx_i. can calculate MRS (see ch3) with this, via dx_i  dx_j = (dU/dx_i) / (dU / dx_j).
* example: for w = walking time to bus or car in minutes, t = trip time in minutes, c = trip cost in dollars. U(w,t,c) = -.147w - .0411t - 2.24c predicts 93% of bus vs car choices! this is amazing. from the [lecture](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2000/mcfadden-lecture.pdf) it looks like this may be a simplification of the actual work.
